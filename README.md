- 👋 Hi, I’m @nomeacuerdo!
- 🥑 Javascript Developer, based in Bogotá, Colombia.
- 💆‍♂️ Highly experienced in Frontend technologies with a great deal of experience in Node.js.
- 🙅‍♂️ My weapon of choice is React, don't like Angular, but will code it for food.
- 🗿 I'm actually quite good at Git! Turns out that many experienced developers can't tell the difference between a rebase and an interactive rebase.
- 🌱 Currently starting to dig a little bit of Python, Let's see how it goes.
- 📫 You can reach me via DM, in Mastodon as nomeacuerdo@col.social or through nomeacuerdo.co
